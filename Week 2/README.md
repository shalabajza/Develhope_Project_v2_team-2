## Week 2 (Danilo Marinkovic): 
- Create a table containing the unique names of all categories from the dataset
- Plot a bar chart for categories with the total number of downloads in each category 
- Plot a bar chart for the total prices of each paid app in each category (the sum of all prices in the same category)
- Plot a bar chart for total profit in each category (number of downloads per app * price per app)

Task was done in SQL first (created SQLite .db by importing the .CSV, in separate folder labeled 'sql'), then later updated to run inside a notebook using Python ('week_2.ipynb'). Plots were exported into 'plots' folder for future use.
